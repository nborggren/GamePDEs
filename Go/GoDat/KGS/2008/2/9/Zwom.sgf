mud [?\]: i meant to play p7

Ubiquity [-\]: you have some stones on the left
Ubiquity [-\]: is that why you chose this move?
Ubiquity [-\]: to build a moyo?
Zwom [-\]: yes, I thought it made him overconcentrated and reinforced my shape
Zwom [-\]: build moyo

Zwom [-\]: thanks
Zwom [-\]: really?
mud [?\]: i have no idea how i could ever win this
mud [?\]: ever
mud [?\]: pretty sure i've been behind since q6
mud [?\]: by a billion
Zwom [-\]: I'll turn on coordinates so I can see what you are talking about.
mud [?\]: ill see if greg can review
FlameBlade [-\]: that weird push on lower right
Zwom [-\]: oh I see.
mud [?\]: i meant to play the knights move, then i didn't...and the knights move wasn't even very good
Zwom [-\]: I still think I'm losing
mud [?\]: i have no idea how that'd be possible
mud [?\]: i barely have points
Zwom [-\]: I'll pass control to greg
Ubiquity [-\]: wow, you resigned this game josh?
mud [?\]: yeah
Ubiquity [-\]: anyway josh
Ubiquity [-\]: you give up too easily
Ubiquity [-\]: you should count first
Ubiquity [-\]: or did you?
mud [?\]: i did, but i guess i was pessimistic or something
mud [?\]: if you still think i can win
Ubiquity [-\]: there's a raeson there are no time limits
Ubiquity [-\]: it's so you can be more accurate
Ubiquity [-\]: well, N7 hurts you a little
Ubiquity [-\]: but you should still wait until the game is clearer
Ubiquity [-\]: before deciding to resign
mud [?\]: okay
Ubiquity [-\]: weird resignations in vacuous space are bad
FlameBlade [-\]: and this sorta still is a fight
Ubiquity [-\]: wait until you're definitely behind
Ubiquity [-\]: with no way to make it up
Ubiquity [-\]: then you can resign
Ubiquity [-\]: but here there's still possibilities all over
Ubiquity [-\]: there are
mud [?\]: alright, i will from now on
Ubiquity [-\]: ok
Ubiquity [-\]: good game
mud [?\]: thanks for the review
Ubiquity [-\]: np
mud [?\]: and thanks again for the game nathan
Zwom [-\]: thanks greg, josh
Zwom [-\]: thanks for resigning
mud [?\]: haha
Ubiquity [-\]: haha
Zwom [-\]: thanks for watching everybody too
mud [?\]: hmm, i hope i can play another game tonight
mud [?\]: there's still a lot of games left
Zwom [-\]: it seems g5 was really bad of me to forget
Zwom [-\]: yeah is this going to be a three week round?
Zwom [-\]: after all?
Ubiquity [-\]: yeah, probably
Ubiquity [-\]: unless you guys manage to finish faster
mud [?\]: i think i can finish in 2
mud [?\]: but i'll see
mud [?\]: is kei still playing?
mud [?\]: or did he drop out?
Zwom [-\]: I prefer three, it gives time for problems and review of the reviews 
Ubiquity [-\]: kei dropped
mud [?\]: okay
Ubiquity [-\]: if you need 3 that's fine
Vash3G [?\]: review over?
Ubiquity [-\]: i doubt everyone will finish before that
Ubiquity [-\]: yes
FlameBlade [-\]: okay, 3 more people for me then
Zwom [-\]: bye
mud [?\]: dan maybe we'll have time to play tonight, if you're around?
FlameBlade [-\]: I'm not sure.
FlameBlade [-\]: I'm kinda coming down with something.
mud [?\]: oh lame :(
FlameBlade [-\]: yeah, I left work early yesterday
FlameBlade [-\]: and napped for like 4 hours.
mud [?\]: ahh
mud [?\]: damn
mud [?\]: i hope you feel better
FlameBlade [-\]: yeah, I'm totally screwed up now
FlameBlade [-\]: me too
FlameBlade [-\]: though, I did play nick last night...only because I wanted to finish the game
mud [?\]: nizzity or hobo?
FlameBlade [-\]: haha
FlameBlade [-\]: hobo
mud [?\]: oh, cool
mud [?\]: ill have to look at that later
FlameBlade [-\]: so maybe I can play tonight
FlameBlade [-\]: but not sure.

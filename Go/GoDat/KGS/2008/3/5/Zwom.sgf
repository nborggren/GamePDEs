FlameBlade [-\]: not sure
FlameBlade [-\]: I think it's a possible fuseki
FlameBlade [-\]: cash vs influence
Zwom [-\]: I liked it more then the cut
FlameBlade [-\]: S11 is possible
FlameBlade [-\]: though, I think R10 is more normal to start with
FlameBlade [-\]: was surprised when you asked for undo
Zwom [-\]: I didn't think so with your stone at 3-4
Zwom [-\]: 4-4 I'd agree with you
FlameBlade [-\]: though
FlameBlade [-\]: I think cut may be more interesting
FlameBlade [-\]: mostly because R16 is a bit further
FlameBlade [-\]: but I have no clue haha
FlameBlade [-\]: though, I think black should have extended to Q11
FlameBlade [-\]: feels tons easier to handle
Zwom [-\]: I thought you would push and get more liberties before hane
Zwom [-\]: yeah
FlameBlade [-\]: R11 is possible
FlameBlade [-\]: just frigging complicated
Zwom [-\]: let's see if the g's are around
FlameBlade [-\]: the double G
FlameBlade [-\]: he's on as Tabemasu
FlameBlade [-\]: that's Gus
Zwom [-\]: ok, I was wondering why a six dan and 4 dan were watching us
FlameBlade [-\]: oh, vices
FlameBlade [-\]: I used to study some with him
FlameBlade [-\]: and there's GeorgeW
FlameBlade [-\]: that's another 4d
FlameBlade [-\]: he likes to annoy me with corrections on my openings and yose
FlameBlade [-\]: haha
Zwom [-\]: hey greg
Ubiquity [-\]: hi
FlameBlade [-\]: hey Greg
Zwom [-\]: it's all yours
FlameBlade [-\]: guess only thing that I had a problem with this game is D3
FlameBlade [-\]: haha
Zwom [-\]: So my primary mistake was not responding in top left?
Ubiquity [-\]: nice game though

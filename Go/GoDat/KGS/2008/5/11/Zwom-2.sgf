Zwom [-\]: to me it seems just as big as approaching the corner
FlameBlade [-\]: I see.
Zwom [-\]: but the difference is
Zwom [-\]: black needs two more moves to enclose top corner
Zwom [-\]: and only one move to take the side
GeorgeW [-\]: Zwom can I see ctrl? I shall show you something to make you feel better
Zwom [-\]: it's all yours

GeorgeW [-\]: Stones are defective
FlameBlade [-\]: haha
Zwom [-\]: anything else of go interest?
Zwom [-\]: anybody have anything to show?
GeorgeW [-\]: do reading problems
Zwom [-\]: ok.
Zwom [-\]: given my time to devote to go it's probably best 
Zwom [-\]: over these stupid games
Zwom [-\]: that just fluster me
Zwom [-\]: thanks for the tips
GeorgeW [-\]: no problem
GeorgeW [-\]: imo
GeorgeW [-\]: mentality of go is more important than technique or go
Zwom [-\]: how do you improve mentality?
GeorgeW [-\]: well
GeorgeW [-\]: follow the advice i gave you
GeorgeW [-\]: instead of thinking about the game
GeorgeW [-\]: think about how you should think about the game
Zwom [-\]: i'll try

;W[oi]WL[266.051]C[GeorgeW [-\]: Do you know this white
Zwom [-\]: I was still completely convinced this was good for white
GeorgeW [-\]: you are letting a simple invasion fluster you and that decided the game
Zwom [-\]: 4 times I know this much
Zwom [-\]: not flustering me is the issue
FlameBlade [-\]: okay
FlameBlade [-\]: here's another idea
FlameBlade [-\]: play R5
FlameBlade [-\]: instead
Zwom [-\]: so the lesson 
Zwom [-\]: is
FlameBlade [-\]: you just have bigger extension
Zwom [-\]: blitz go is not go
GeorgeW [-\]: well
GeorgeW [-\]: no
GeorgeW [-\]: it is hard to express
Zwom [-\]: or the good go move is not necessarily the good blitz go move

;B[iq]BL[266.588]C[FlameBlade [-\]: strange joseki here and there...
FlameBlade [-\]: traps here and there...
Zwom [-\]: at this point though whose stones would you rather have?
Zwom [-\]: noticing it's white's turn
GeorgeW [-\]: depends on my opponent
GeorgeW [-\]: haha
GeorgeW [-\]: Gods!
FlameBlade [-\]: if you were playing against me, GW...
FlameBlade [-\]: who would you pick?
GeorgeW [-\]: I'll take Black still
FlameBlade [-\]: hahaha
FlameBlade [-\]: not surprising
GeorgeW [-\]: I've quite a few dirty tricks up my sleeve if you haven't noticed
FlameBlade [-\]: hee hee
GeorgeW [-\]: My damn ringtone for text messages gives me a heart attack everytime
GeorgeW [-\]: I've still not gotten used to it
FlameBlade [-\]: ok, your phone number?
FlameBlade [-\]: I can text you during games
FlameBlade [-\]: ;D
FlameBlade [-\]: kidding, of course
Zwom [-\]: these two games make me hate go.
Zwom [-\]: even more then usual
GeorgeW [-\]: Cuz you lost?
Zwom [-\]: I don't mind losing
Zwom [-\]: I mind losing and not being able to learn why
GeorgeW [-\]: you were tricked
GeorgeW [-\]: and for the 2d and under level it is easier to play territory than influence
GeorgeW [-\]: thats the 3rd damn time in 2 minutes btw
FlameBlade [-\]: also
GeorgeW [-\]: I'm gonna die before I'm 25
FlameBlade [-\]: next time you play Capone...
FlameBlade [-\]: take diagonal
Zwom [-\]: ok
GeorgeW [-\]: no
GeorgeW [-\]: next time
GeorgeW [-\]: play 3-3
GeorgeW [-\]: lol
Zwom [-\]: but thinking of go existentially
FlameBlade [-\]: haha
FlameBlade [-\]: also
Zwom [-\]: as in what is the best move on the board right now
FlameBlade [-\]: I have a question
FlameBlade [-\]: after black played F3
FlameBlade [-\]: why did you play C10?
]
;W[jp]WL[262.383]C[FlameBlade [-\]: it is the issue
FlameBlade [-\]: to me, you lacked the plans for the invasions
Zwom [-\]: as in, how do I deal with the god damn invasions
GeorgeW [-\]: hes on quite the winning streak
GeorgeW [-\]: capone that is
FlameBlade [-\]: I checked few of his games
FlameBlade [-\]: seems like he likes to try some dirty tricks
FlameBlade [-\]: to get upperhand
Zwom [-\]: seems to do good
Zwom [-\]: stanley fuseki can beat all kyu players?
Zwom [-\]: on kgs?
FlameBlade [-\]: black did stanley fuseki wrong
FlameBlade [-\]: =)
Zwom [-\]: but same idea more or less
GeorgeW [-\]: Dan I can always trick kyus, it is so much fun too
FlameBlade [-\]: indeed
FlameBlade [-\]: a little crosscut here and there...

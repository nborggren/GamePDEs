Bogoliubon [2k\]: and I should probably be lighter.
Bogoliubon [2k\]: well first
Bogoliubon [2k\]: let me recapitulate
Bogoliubon [2k\]: make sense?
logicg8 [5k\]: yup
Bogoliubon [2k\]: besides
Bogoliubon [2k\]: you may have to make moves in your own territory
Bogoliubon [2k\]: to get rid of the ko
Bogoliubon [2k\]: threats
Bogoliubon [2k\]: a point loss
Bogoliubon [2k\]: that
Bogoliubon [2k\]: s what the rule is trying to protect against
Bogoliubon [2k\]: chinese rules
Bogoliubon [2k\]: a stone is a point
Bogoliubon [2k\]: and a grid is a point
Bogoliubon [2k\]: so you are free to put stones in your own territory
Bogoliubon [2k\]: chinese rules are interesting
logicg8 [5k\]: I have a question about them
Bogoliubon [2k\]: I'll see what I can do
logicg8 [5k\]: how do they deal with games that are longer than 361 moves?
Bogoliubon [2k\]: I'm not much of an expert
Bogoliubon [2k\]: well you never need more then 361 stones
Bogoliubon [2k\]: so their ok in that sense
logicg8 [5k\]: just swap prisoners?
Bogoliubon [2k\]: yeah
Bogoliubon [2k\]: or a notepad
Bogoliubon [2k\]: I was playing with math
Bogoliubon [2k\]: and I managed, (in rough draft form)
Bogoliubon [2k\]: to not even need to define territory to define go
Bogoliubon [2k\]: if you count like the chinese do
Bogoliubon [2k\]: you can make winning a condition of liberties
logicg8 [5k\]: How did you manage that?
Bogoliubon [2k\]: I'll show with paper
Bogoliubon [2k\]: but basically the idea
logicg8 [5k\]: fill in all spaces
Bogoliubon [2k\]: is, yes fill in all spaces
logicg8 [5k\]: and last with a liberty wins?
Bogoliubon [2k\]: whoever has an illegal move first
Bogoliubon [2k\]: will always lose
Bogoliubon [2k\]: whoever has the least territory
Bogoliubon [2k\]: will have the first illegal move
logicg8 [5k\]: I see
Bogoliubon [2k\]: so it's kind of cool to me at least,
Bogoliubon [2k\]: that that's the case.
Bogoliubon [2k\]: go isn't about territory, it's about liberties.
Bogoliubon [2k\]: if you want to think about it that way
logicg8 [5k\]: That's a neat change in perspectie
Bogoliubon [2k\]: yeah I thought so too.  I thought it was funny noticing it via math

(;B[hn]BL[45]OB[5]C[Bogoliubon [2k\]: I guess I never filled in all the stones before

;W[jn]WL[212.529]C[Bogoliubon [2k\]: but no

Bogoliubon [2k\]: any ideas what to do now?
Bogoliubon [2k\]: white need not resign yet
Bogoliubon [2k\]: especially if he's read my book
logicg8 [5k\]: need to make shape, so maybe g4
Bogoliubon [2k\]: so you assess what resources you have around
Bogoliubon [2k\]: and try to use them
Bogoliubon [2k\]: there's four full lines between
Bogoliubon [2k\]: g and k
Bogoliubon [2k\]: below
Bogoliubon [2k\]: the center is not far
Bogoliubon [2k\]: g11
Bogoliubon [2k\]: could get to be pretty vulnerable for white
Bogoliubon [2k\]: and then of course, you could count your losses
Bogoliubon [2k\]: and revert back to the sacrifice
Bogoliubon [2k\]: but that's harder now with h6 there

Bogoliubon [2k\]: so now I can just make some shape
logicg8 [5k\]: always helpful in a tight spot like this one
Bogoliubon [2k\]: I should probably resist making him stonger
Bogoliubon [2k\]: but I'm giving him a chance all the same
Bogoliubon [2k\]: in that whatever happens

Joven [?\]: maybe N3 instead?
Bogoliubon [-\]: I like the left side more then the ottom
Joven [?\]: yeah but he's behind  so he needs to make you have a weak group
Joven [?\]: I dunno
Bogoliubon [-\]: it feels like it would make r7 equally weak.  
Bogoliubon [-\]: it's pretty weak anyway with the p16 thing.
Bogoliubon [-\]: but yeah
Joven [?\]: yeah

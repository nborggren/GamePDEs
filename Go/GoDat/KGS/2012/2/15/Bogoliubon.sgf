Bogoliubon [-\]: what would you have done?
Bogoliubon [-\]: for 6
logicg8 [?\]: k17
logicg8 [?\]: or 16
logicg8 [?\]: r10
Bogoliubon [-\]: Id r13
Bogoliubon [-\]: r10
Bogoliubon [-\]: rather
logicg8 [?\]: or approach with o17 but definitely not this

;W[qm]C[Bogoliubon [-\]: now what should black do.
Bogoliubon [-\]: ?
logicg8 [?\]: M3
Bogoliubon [-\]: thats my impulse too, but that gives white first move up top.
Bogoliubon [-\]: I want k16

;B[pj]C[logicg8 [?\]: If I was playing on top I'd want to approach with f 17
]
;W[pk]C[Bogoliubon [-\]: o17 feels low for that for me.  Also just san-san is a possibility
Bogoliubon [-\]: after k16
Bogoliubon [-\]: depending on whites response.

Bogoliubon [-\]: who do you like?
logicg8 [?\]: b
Bogoliubon [-\]: it seems really even to me
Bogoliubon [-\]: with n3 on the board and komi
Bogoliubon [-\]: but Id take black too, if I had to choose
logicg8 [?\]: W's bottom left is big but no potential nor from w's right
Bogoliubon [-\]: and c17, c16 and c14 irritating
Bogoliubon [-\]: by black.

Bogoliubon [-\]: those were my lessons.
Bogoliubon [-\]: I like this game.
logicg8 [?\]: It's a fun one
Bogoliubon [-\]: indeed.  so youll be at Princeton then?
logicg8 [?\]: I'm planning on it
logicg8 [?\]: I still need to book a hotel
logicg8 [?\]: Philly is a bit far isn't it?
Bogoliubon [-\]: my friend lives about 15 minutes from the trenton stop
Bogoliubon [-\]: if you wanted to get a place though Id probably be down.
Bogoliubon [-\]: but its a 45 minute commute
Bogoliubon [-\]: not that big of a deal.
Bogoliubon [-\]: hans bethe commuted from NYC
logicg8 [?\]: crazy
Bogoliubon [-\]: and he managed just fine
Bogoliubon [-\]: its closer to the city then we are on the island.
Bogoliubon [-\]: and trenton is closer still.
Bogoliubon [-\]: Id like to see my friends there too.
Bogoliubon [-\]: I should run, I think amber and I are going to dine now.
logicg8 [?\]: okay

Bogoliubon [-\]: this move turned out to be right in the throat.
logicg8 [?\]: I need to be bolder when I attack

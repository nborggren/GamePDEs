toxxicu [9d?\]: playing on 2 sides at once
toxxicu [9d?\]: it's not big vs urgent

toxxicu [9d?\]: in order to become strong at go
toxxicu [9d?\]: you need to find your weakness in real life
toxxicu [9d?\]: and improve that

toxxicu [9d?\]: haha
toxxicu [9d?\]: what she meant
toxxicu [9d?\]: was that flaws in ones personality

toxxicu [9d?\]: everything is apparent on the go board

toxxicu [9d?\]: you can not improve on the board alone
Zwom [7k\]: what you say is very interesting.
toxxicu [9d?\]: really ?
toxxicu [9d?\]: i thought everyone noticed it :)
toxxicu [9d?\]: i mean go players
toxxicu [9d?\]: can't you sometime guess a player by their moves
toxxicu [9d?\]: like Captain :D
Zwom [7k\]: I thought it was the opposite.  that because it doesn't happen in real life you make it happen on the go board
toxxicu [9d?\]: well in real life you don't get feedback as fast and as clear as in go
toxxicu [9d?\]: it's much easier to blame someone
toxxicu [9d?\]: for your own mistakes
toxxicu [9d?\]: misreadings
toxxicu [9d?\]: there are lots of people doing that in go too :)
toxxicu [9d?\]: blaming their opponent for their loss
toxxicu [9d?\]: don't you hear everyday about people complaining about misfortunes and other people doing bad things 
toxxicu [9d?\]: ?
Zwom [7k\]: of course.
toxxicu [9d?\]: it's maybe a way to hide their weakness
toxxicu [9d?\]: weakness they will never get rid of
toxxicu [9d?\]: because they deny it :)
toxxicu [9d?\]: go is a good game to build up character

toxxicu [9d?\]: hmm
toxxicu [9d?\]: i don't know joseki here
Zwom [7k\]: Ma Xiaochun is the only pro I've seen use it.
toxxicu [9d?\]: i've seen it 
toxxicu [9d?\]: but it's not played often enough to call joseki
toxxicu [9d?\]: c14
toxxicu [9d?\]: that's simple

toxxicu [9d?\]: did you try gobase for some games with this variation?
Zwom [7k\]: no I didn't.
Zwom [7k\]: I should though.
Zwom [7k\]: but in the games I've seen it in it seems people improvise for 50 moves
toxxicu [9d?\]: looking at games where seq were played
toxxicu [9d?\]: is more interesting than a joseki book
toxxicu [9d?\]: with empty boards
Zwom [7k\]: I agree.  joseki books aren't helpful with this one either.
Zwom [7k\]: white almost always had a d4 stone too
toxxicu [9d?\]: studying pro games is enough joseki study
toxxicu [9d?\]: you can see all the josekis you need in current games :)
toxxicu [9d?\]: and the strength you get from studying those can help you in places like "new" josekis you don't know
toxxicu [9d?\]: shall we play now ?
Zwom [7k\]: come to think of it I did have a game yesterday that touched on something we talked about last time
Zwom [7k\]: in a moment
Zwom [7k\]: one last question
toxxicu [9d?\]: sure
Zwom [7k\]: I'll load it.
toxxicu [9d?\]: ok

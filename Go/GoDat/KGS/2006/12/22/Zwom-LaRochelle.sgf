LaRochelle [19k\]: Zac, Sean, Martin, Chris C., Chris B., and Nick are pretty much the "rat pack" now.

Zwom [2k\]: but it's not that great.
LaRochelle [19k\]: How many clubs do you get to play with?
Zwom [2k\]: one club.  and two "kiwons" there places in the city that charge a $7 playing fee and provide the coffee and 4 dans.
LaRochelle [19k\]: Coffee and 4 dans, interesting combination.

Zwom [2k\]: one of my friends is coming in from tucson and we'll meet up in the city.

twattsir [6k\]: yes
Zwom [2k\]: I was in no hurry to do anything with that stone
Zwom [2k\]: I had completely forgotten about it til you played this stone.
twattsir [6k\]: i guess i was thinking that
twattsir [6k\]: you were ahead in territory and I better get some
Zwom [2k\]: but think more dramatically then this
Zwom [2k\]: the directional mistake here is mine I think
Zwom [2k\]: the question right now is what is bigger the top or the rightside
twattsir [6k\]: how do you determine
Zwom [2k\]: I choose the top but it's probably the right side
twattsir [6k\]: black does have the bad aji on the top
twattsir [6k\]: not life and death
twattsir [6k\]: but still not great shape
Zwom [2k\]: well there's the literal sense: there are 9 spaces on the right and 10 on the top
Zwom [2k\]: so the top is bigger in that sense
twattsir [6k\]: ok
twattsir [6k\]: is that a rule of thumb
Zwom [2k\]: however white has A and Black has B
Zwom [2k\]: typically straight counting is not enough, there are other things to consider
twattsir [6k\]: if black comes out at g8 can he possibly kill white corner
Zwom [2k\]: correct is the top or the right
]
(;W[kc]WL[960.981]C[Zwom [2k\]: so I think that more then compensates for the one line difference between the top and the side
Zwom [2k\]: That is a fuseki question despite how many stones are on the board
]
;B[bq]BL[1064.116]C[twattsir [6k\]: or is it style
twattsir [6k\]: ok
Zwom [2k\]: this is endgame
]
(;W[hn]WL[951.91]C[Zwom [2k\]: you are doing it as a forcing move so maybe it's ok
twattsir [6k\]: which is why I thought the extension
twattsir [6k\]: now does this begin to cause black any concerns
Zwom [2k\]: white is a lot weaker then black so no.
Zwom [2k\]: but you are trying to win on points

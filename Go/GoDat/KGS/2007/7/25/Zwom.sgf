Zwom [2k\]: I thought that that was an interesting exchange
slapidus [-\]: Im not sure if Im a fan
slapidus [-\]: doesnt mean its not good.. but I think I couldnt pull it off
slapidus [-\]: white has alot to keep an eye on
Zwom [2k\]: it's hard to give away shapes like the one on the bottom.  at the same time white has played a very fast opening
Zwom [2k\]: which is hard as white

slapidus [-\]: Id want to attack the upper right white stone

slapidus [-\]: poor white
slapidus [-\]: so close
Zwom [2k\]: it seems ko still
Zwom [2k\]: is that what you are reading?
slapidus [-\]: especcially since black has a local ko threat
Zwom [2k\]: I think more then that since black can just remove liberties on 06 group as threats too.
slapidus [-\]: thats what I meant by local ko threat
Zwom [2k\]: ok it was the prefix "a" which I had considered singular
slapidus [-\]: yeah
slapidus [-\]: brain is wacky
slapidus [-\]: Im gonna lay do for a few minutes
slapidus [-\]: before its time to get going
slapidus [-\]: you gonna come down here?
Zwom [2k\]: sure
slapidus [-\]: ok.. sounds good
Zwom [2k\]: we can have a mellow go club night at the lapidus house
Zwom [2k\]: if you guys are too tired
slapidus [-\]: I think carrie wants to go stop some people at huntington. ;p
slapidus [-\]: so when you gonna come by?
Zwom [2k\]: ok then.  I'll show up around 7 I guess if that works
slapidus [-\]: ok.. how about 6:30? that way if we go to huntington we have some time to get food
Zwom [2k\]: ok
Zwom [2k\]: see you then

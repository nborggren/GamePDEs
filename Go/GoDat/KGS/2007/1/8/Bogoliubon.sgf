;B[jq]C[Bogoliubon [2k\]: for kicks I played this fuseki as black in my tournament games.
toxxicu [7d\]: was it succesful ?
Bogoliubon [2k\]: moderately.  I got gigantic frameworks but lost do to mishandling invasions.
Bogoliubon [2k\]: the mistakes weren't fuseki mistakes.
toxxicu [7d\]: it's a good way to train against invasions then

Bogoliubon [2k\]: we'll play now.
toxxicu [7d\]: ok

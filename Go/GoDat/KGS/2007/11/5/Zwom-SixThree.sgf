;W[ok]WL[561.428]C[SixThree [3k\]: gg, thanks
Zwom [1k\]: thanks
Zwom [1k\]: you have gotten better
Zwom [1k\]: you get greedy though
SixThree [3k\]: shut up this was a stupid game
SixThree [3k\]: i'm make stupid mistakes
Zwom [1k\]: me too
SixThree [3k\]: i have no consisntency in my play, half of my games are briliiant and the other half are retarded
Zwom [1k\]: sounds like me
Zwom [1k\]: have you ever beat a dan player?
Zwom [1k\]: even?
SixThree [3k\]: no
SixThree [3k\]: 1kyus even though
SixThree [3k\]: beat a 2dan at 2 stones
Zwom [1k\]: I beat a 2 dan even at the rochester tournament.  I bet you could beat 1 dans 3 out of 10 times even
Zwom [1k\]: if you can find any around
Zwom [1k\]: is it true martin is 5 dan?
SixThree [3k\]: HA! that would be nice.  by the way half the people at club don't think i'm a 1kyu even though that's my rank now
Zwom [1k\]: what's your sigma?
SixThree [3k\]: martin is more like a 4 dan.  at phoenix tournaments he plays as a 6 dan.  he wins 2 out of 10 games and that boosts him from a 4 dan to a 6 dan. but he lost all of his 5 dan division games at congress
SixThree [3k\]: check the aga ratins webpage
SixThree [3k\]: i mean 5 dan
Zwom [1k\]: I am now.  that's what I figured, martin is a shameless self premoter
SixThree [3k\]: boosts to a 5 dan
SixThree [3k\]: only way he gets a 5 dan rating is through handicap games
Zwom [1k\]: I see.  I have a friend in CT that is an honest to god 5 dan.  It's disgusting how good he is
SixThree [3k\]: there's this guy named ryan from portland that is going to the U of A, but he very rarely shows up to club becuase he only likes to play even games, and he's a 5 dan
Zwom [1k\]: my go has dropped down to close to zero.  I play like 10 games a month anymore.
SixThree [3k\]: i still try to play a game a day on kgs, but it's harder nowadays with school
Zwom [1k\]: school here is insane
SixThree [3k\]: and i try to take breaks from it because sometimes i become to obsessive
Zwom [1k\]: that sounds healthy.  
SixThree [3k\]: so you're in grad school right?
Zwom [1k\]: yeah.  
Zwom [1k\]: I'm done with classwork now, I just have to right one of those dissertations
Zwom [1k\]: write
Zwom [1k\]: but physics is hard
Zwom [1k\]: not as hard as go, but still hard
SixThree [3k\]: god those things sound hard, if i went to grad school for math, i would have write a 100pg dissertations that comes up with a whole new way of proving two different theorems
Zwom [1k\]: are you undergraduate math right now?
SixThree [3k\]: yeah
SixThree [3k\]: with an emphasis on computer science
Zwom [1k\]: that's cool.  I didn't know that.  I got a degree in math too.
Zwom [1k\]: and I'm taking a math class right now, for fun.
SixThree [3k\]: nice. how many degrees do you have?
Zwom [1k\]: 3.  a physics, undergrad, a  math undergrad, and a physics masters
SixThree [3k\]: wow that's a lot
Zwom [1k\]: I'm old too though.  I just turned 28 yesterday
Zwom [1k\]: or friday rather
SixThree [3k\]: nah that's not bad, i'm going to be 25 on the 22nd of this month
Zwom [1k\]: my mom's birthday is the 23rd.  funny.  what math are you taking now?
SixThree [3k\]: calc 2
Zwom [1k\]: oh.  so you're just warming up to the powers of mathematics.
Zwom [1k\]: you've got a year or so before it starts getting real fun.  linear algebra, and abstract algebra
SixThree [3k\]: don't remind.  this is the 2nd time i switched my major, plus i haven't been going to school all the time since high school
Zwom [1k\]: well you switched it to the right major
SixThree [3k\]: i hope so
patrickb [1d?\]: Martin, a shameless self-promoter? Who would have guessed :)
Zwom [1k\]: I mean that effectionately
SixThree [3k\]: lol
patrickb [1d?\]: Sure. I have a sharp eye from swindles learning to play with Martin and John Goltz :)
SixThree [3k\]: yep, and john lamont
patrickb [1d?\]: sokadoka!
Zwom [1k\]: sounds like tucson go club is thriving.  the stony brook club kind of sucks.  I inevitably spend all the time giving handicap stones on 9x9 boards
patrickb [1d?\]: sounds sort of like me in albuquerque.
patrickb [1d?\]: We have one person who's a 4k on here (Demoneyes)
patrickb [1d?\]: and two who are around 10k
SixThree [3k\]: 50 years from now i'm going to replace john lamont as the eccentric old math proffessor that doesn't tie his shoes, calling people "youngins"
patrickb [1d?\]: heh
patrickb [1d?\]: who only comes out at night
SixThree [3k\]: yeah, and sits in his car for a half hour smoking his pipe before coming into IHOP
patrickb [1d?\]: lol
patrickb [1d?\]: My wife always called him ghoulish, between the smoke smell, the long white hair, and the fact that he only came out at night. But he's not a bad go player
patrickb [1d?\]: Not as good as he thinks he is, but not bad at all
patrickb [1d?\]: I assume he and martin still don't play?
Zwom [1k\]: well I'm going to get going.  thanks for the game chris.  you'll beat me even someday, maybe 
Zwom [1k\]: but not if I can help it
patrickb [1d?\]: heh
patrickb [1d?\]: late guys
patrickb [1d?\]: later, that is
SixThree [3k\]: no, back in his heyday, before the AGA formed, he was a Japanese rated 1dan, but now he's gone down in strength to about a 3kyu.  yeah lamont never takes stones from anyone, and the only one he plays high handicap is goltz
SixThree [3k\]: see ya, i'll show you that game later
Zwom [1k\]: ok.

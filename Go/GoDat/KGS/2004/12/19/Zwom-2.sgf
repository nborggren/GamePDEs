eborggren [?\]: How are you doing?
Zwom [16k\]: not bad.  sorry about the confusion yesterday.
Zwom [16k\]: how about yourself?
eborggren [?\]: I am doing well, enjoying the start of my break
Zwom [16k\]: so this is a 9x9 go board 10 lines short of regulation.
eborggren [?\]: Sorry I am not overly familiar with this site, so it will take me a little to get used ot it
Zwom [16k\]: No thang.
Zwom [16k\]: Right now I have it on demonstration, cause I'll be showing you some tricks.
Zwom [16k\]: in a bit will open up an actual game.
eborggren [?\]: ok
Zwom [16k\]: Did you read up at allor would you like me to go over the rules?
eborggren [?\]: I read the e-mail you sent but was difficult for me understand without actually seeing it
eborggren [?\]: Probably need to go over the rules
Zwom [16k\]: Alright.  The point of the game is to surround more territory than your opponent.
Zwom [16k\]: You do this by putting your stones on the grid naturally.
Zwom [16k\]: When your in the beginning of a game play is typically in the corners...

eborggren [?\]: yes, that is why you don't put positions way out front?
Zwom [16k\]: now when pieces are stuck together like a and b.  they'll live and die together.
eborggren [?\]: I see that now
Zwom [16k\]: white would need to surround all the triangular points.
Zwom [16k\]: takes six stones to kill 2.  kind of unlikely.
Zwom [16k\]: but strange things happen all the time in this game.

eborggren [?\]: score is number of intesections inhabitted and in control of
Zwom [16k\]: the score is the number of intersections surrounded + the number of dead stones of your opponent.
eborggren [?\]: oh
Zwom [16k\]: so no point for the grid points you occupy.
eborggren [?\]: ok
Zwom [16k\]: one nice thing about go is the rules are simple.

;B[ee]CR[ee]LB[fd:1]C[Zwom [17k\]: what do you know about liberties?
rikolau [30k?\]: ok
Zwom [17k\]: the game is of taking territory. not killing.  
Zwom [17k\]: this move here has a pretty bad vulnerability at 1

;W[fd]LB[df:1][gf:2]C[rikolau [30k?\]: liberties, i guess im fine with, but wouldnt hurt to go over again
rikolau [30k?\]: ok
Zwom [17k\]: and that is exactly where I went.
Zwom [17k\]: do you see why?
rikolau [30k?\]: cuts me off 
Zwom [17k\]: right.   3 the attacker just got attacked back harder.
Zwom [17k\]: notice 2 and 4 are considerably closer together than 1 and three.
Zwom [17k\]: 1 and two are still connected. if you try to cut...
rikolau [30k?\]: ok

eborggren [?\]: Interesting game, I thought I new what I was doing at times, but turned out, I had no clue...
eborggren [?\]: like you said it will come with time.
Zwom [16k\]: this game does require some patience.
Zwom [16k\]: but it's fun.
eborggren [?\]: Yeah...its good though, I am looking forward to doing this together
Zwom [16k\]: me too.

eborggren [?\]: against each other of course!
Zwom [16k\]: alright, 
Zwom [16k\]: I hope you get into it enough where you crave more than that.

Zwom [16k\]: I'll talk to you later.

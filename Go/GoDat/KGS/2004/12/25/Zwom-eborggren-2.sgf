Zwom [16k\]: this was a good move too. if you ignored the cut I would have gotten 3 if not four stones.
eborggren [?\]: not sure what I was thinking there accept that it looked open and felt it need to be fully blocked
Zwom [16k\]: which was 1of 2 correct moves.  (e7 also works)
Zwom [16k\]: protecting typically costs you a move so only protect when it is totally necessary.

Zwom [16k\]: it's a good game.  I hope you get into it.
Zwom [16k\]: thanks for the present, yours will be coming probably mid january.
Zwom [16k\]: why not extend the holiday season?
eborggren [?\]: we'll see how much additional time besides playing with you I can invest, but this is tons of fun as is
eborggren [?\]: I wish!

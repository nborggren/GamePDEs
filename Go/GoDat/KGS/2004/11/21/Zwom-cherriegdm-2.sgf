cherriegdm [25k\]: oh sorry, I didnt read the message till now#
cherriegdm [25k\]: I am 25 y o
cherriegdm [25k\]: and you?
Zwom [22k\]: I'm 25 as of november 2
cherriegdm [25k\]: I see :)  I wil be 26 on 3rd december
cherriegdm [25k\]: and where are you from?
Zwom [22k\]: you don't live in AZ do you?  we can get coffee and you can teach me how to play obviously.
cherriegdm [25k\]: oh come on!!!  I play about 20 kyu in real life.  I live in austria, vienna
Zwom [22k\]: that's cool.  
cherriegdm [25k\]: You live in Arizona?
Zwom [22k\]: That is correct.
cherriegdm [25k\]: I see.  Approx 10000km away from me :/
Zwom [22k\]: I'd travel 10000km just to see your hair hang down.
cherriegdm [25k\]: lol
cherriegdm [25k\]: how long have you been playing go?
Zwom [22k\]: about 3 months or so.  I just started on the internet go business a few weeks ago and that was when the obsession began.
cherriegdm [25k\]: Aha!  Is there a club around you where you can play in real life?
Zwom [22k\]: yes I've been twice.  I had a few friends too that wanted to learn, but they didn't stick with it and I did.  
cherriegdm [25k\]: Same here
cherriegdm [25k\]: and especially being a girl, it isnt easy to find a company
Zwom [22k\]: that's a bummer.   my real name is nathan not Zwom and I'm not a cartoon.
Zwom [22k\]: Sorry for the lies/
cherriegdm [25k\]: It's a shame that we dont live close to each other.  Otherwise we could both learn together...  Nice to meet you Nathan, I am Cherrie
Zwom [22k\]: I hear that.  Well we can learn together anyways, it's just the big house, kids, and baby blue sedan thing may not work out.
cherriegdm [25k\]: lol!  Kids?  Do you have a few?
Zwom [22k\]: No.  I'm flirting.
cherriegdm [25k\]: hahaha :D  Sorry, I am a bit thick realizing things
Zwom [22k\]: what do you do with your time?  carreer wise and what not.
cherriegdm [25k\]: Well, I am self employed, and have my own tour operator business in vienna
cherriegdm [25k\]: The only things I do, is work or play go since 2 months :D
Zwom [22k\]: that's a bit ambiguous?  are you in the mafia?  sling cocaine?
cherriegdm [25k\]: If I did, I wouldn't be suffering from financial matters now ;)
Zwom [22k\]: excuse me.  I thought you said 4 operator businesses not tour operator.
cherriegdm [25k\]: hehe
cherriegdm [25k\]: and you have your own Go business...?
Zwom [22k\]: Have you ever heard of the cassini spacecraft?
cherriegdm [25k\]: nope, what is that?
Zwom [22k\]: it's a spaceship sent out to saturn about seven years ago.  That's my toy.   I am a rocket scientist.  
cherriegdm [25k\]: oh wow!
cherriegdm [25k\]: Sorry to be dumb, but do you work for the NASA?
Zwom [22k\]: NASA, ESA, JPL, and university of arizona.  I get money from all sorts of corners
cherriegdm [25k\]: May sound strange but the ancient asians used to say that "go is space"
cherriegdm [25k\]: hmm, that sounds fabulous (your work)
Zwom [22k\]: i enjoy it.  It's a good job. but it doesn't pay all that well, cause of that Bush pawn we got stuck with again.  I'm still wearing black and crying myself to sleep.
cherriegdm [25k\]: I am glad that you are not one of his supporters....  
cherriegdm [25k\]: one of the poor 49% 
Zwom [22k\]: honestly if you look at the facts of the election.  bush didn't have 51% in 2000 not even close or in 2004.   The man has no right to speak of democracy he has succesfully rigged two election.
Zwom [22k\]: sorry for my grammar.
cherriegdm [25k\]: shoot.  so the rumours in europe is right
Zwom [22k\]: I think so.  I never met one person who voted for bush.  
cherriegdm [25k\]: hmm...
cherriegdm [25k\]: I think the whole world was unhappy with the outcome
Zwom [22k\]: It's sad.  it's terribly sad/
cherriegdm [25k\]: I feel really sorry for the americans
cherriegdm [25k\]: the REAL americans who didn't support bush
Zwom [22k\]: If world war III begins, I"m going to have to jump ship?  No any place in vienna I can stay...? 
cherriegdm [25k\]: I am a tour operator ;)  I know loads of places where visitors could stay
Zwom [22k\]: I'd be more of an expatriot or a refugee then a visitor.
cherriegdm [25k\]: No problem! :)
cherriegdm [25k\]: I heard that after the elections, there were approximately 10000 visitors on a canadian immigration website.  
Zwom [22k\]: sweet.  that 's a load off my chest.  I've been worried about drafts and bread lines.
cherriegdm [25k\]: I think the whole world will be supportive if you want to migrate somewhere where bush is not in control
Zwom [22k\]: beauty.  I'm not sure what your media is like but here the scary thing lately has been the business of Iran.  The media parallels EXACTLY the talk of iraq a couple years ago.  the conditioning of the masses is beginning again and it hasn't even been three weeks since the 'election'.
cherriegdm [25k\]: OMG!  Is that how white house is trying to provoke the enterprises for war??
Zwom [22k\]: bingo.
cherriegdm [25k\]: perfect way to get money hahaha (sarchasm)
Zwom [22k\]: or good bases for future invasions of spain and italy. (sarcasm)
cherriegdm [25k\]: yeah yeah, and the media is under control by the enterprises who are only after personal wealth
cherriegdm [25k\]: It is terrible
Zwom [22k\]: fox is.  cnn is ok.  NY times and the BBC are OK too.
Zwom [22k\]: fox is straight up propaganda, the others will at least present facts.
Zwom [22k\]: not all ot them but some.
cherriegdm [25k\]: BBC is rather neutral but I don't really know what the brits are doing...  Well, I will go to UK next week anyway.  I will find out
Zwom [22k\]: thanks keep me informed.  You be my spy and I'll be yours.
cherriegdm [25k\]: LOL sure!  Can I add you to my buddy list?
Zwom [22k\]: I hope to shout. 
Zwom [22k\]: what's a buddy list? am I supposed to be keeping one?
Zwom [22k\]: how's that work.
Zwom [22k\]: ?
cherriegdm [25k\]: no it doesn't help that much.  But if you have a buddy list, it is easy to remember the exact name of the person you want to talk to, send a message to, and see if the person is online
cherriegdm [25k\]: First you open the personal information of the person you want to add to your buddy list, then click the box where it says "buddy" or "friend".  
Zwom [22k\]: well I guess its official we're buddies.  I don't think I've had a buddy list since elementary school.
cherriegdm [25k\]: LOL!  True.  
cherriegdm [25k\]: I am online quite frequently.  If you wish for a match, I will be more than happy
Zwom [22k\]: is that your legit email address in there too?  do i have permission to write to you?
cherriegdm [25k\]: Sure.  I dont check that mail often, but I have another address if you want
Zwom [22k\]: please.
cherriegdm [25k\]: c.iizuka@geonet-dm.com
cherriegdm [25k\]: After 2 weeks I started playing go, I went to a tournament in Austria, and lost to bits...  There is a picture of me playing on the website
Zwom [22k\]: on which one?
cherriegdm [25k\]: Well, if you search on google for "Cherrie Iizuka" you will find me.  (unfortunately I cant write links on this chat session... wierd)
cherriegdm [25k\]: http://members.chello.at/pokspace/reports/oesm04.htm
cherriegdm [25k\]: it worked :)
Zwom [22k\]: cool.  I"m not sure what you'll find if you search 'nathan borggren'  
Zwom [22k\]: probably physics and mathematics  mumbo jumbo.
cherriegdm [25k\]: yes, you are on a few PFD files.  Am I right?
Zwom [22k\]: I'll try getting then sending a digital image of myself to you this week.
cherriegdm [25k\]: Thank you :) If you want I can send you my pic too
Zwom [22k\]: a zillion?  which ones stony brook?
Zwom [22k\]: I'd appreciate it.
cherriegdm [25k\]: fp.arizona.edu site
Zwom [22k\]: interesting I thought that was classified.  I better work on my firewall.
cherriegdm [25k\]: oh didn't you want yourself to be on the web?
Zwom [22k\]: I don't mind.  I just want my ideas in journals and books before the public domain.  
cherriegdm [25k\]: Btw, I think the easier way to see my profile is on www.mailfriends.com/profile/ci
Zwom [22k\]: it might just be my office and lab phone number.
cherriegdm [25k\]: Maybe...  I couldn't open adobe files at the moment cause I have deinstalled it.
Zwom [22k\]: well you're certainly cute.  I'll have to put on a tux before I send you my picture.  
cherriegdm [25k\]: come on!  I am nothing special.
Zwom [22k\]: what are you talking about?  a sexy girl beat me twice in girl, my self esteem is shot.
cherriegdm [25k\]: listen, I think it was luck that I won this time.  
Zwom [22k\]: ok I'll brush it off to luck.
Zwom [22k\]: twice in go, not twice in girl, I'm still distracted.
cherriegdm [25k\]: I don't really think the "win and lose" thing is so important in Go.  The only reason why I like to play is because it helps me to think more strategic.  I have lost against really weak players, and sometimes I won by chance again a really strong player
Zwom [22k\]: I hate making mistakes, if I lose because I make mistakes I see red, if I win and made mistakes I see red.
cherriegdm [25k\]: hmm... Do you count your own "free spaces" while you attack the other?
cherriegdm [25k\]: I have seen that in the first round we did, you tried to make a ladder breaker on my side of the board.  That is why I had to respond with a move which was not the most ideal one.
Zwom [22k\]: I try using my intuition as much as possible.  I look at about 14 billion numbers a day at work.  the last thing I want to do for fun is count.
Zwom [22k\]: but there is no avoiding it really.
cherriegdm [25k\]: Same as I.  And I think your intuition is great
cherriegdm [25k\]: Do you care for another round (this time not ranked)?
Zwom [22k\]: thanks cherrie.   sure.
cherriegdm [25k\]: ok, I will make the room

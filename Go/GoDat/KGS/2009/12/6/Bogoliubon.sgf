Joven [-\]: ok I got it
Joven [-\]: want the answer?
Bogoliubon [1k\]: yeah
Bogoliubon [1k\]: the solution in the book says c1, but they only consider the d2 response.
Joven [-\]: yeah seems so
Bogoliubon [1k\]: try this one.
logicg8 [3k\]: w to play b seems too easy
logicg8 [3k\]: ?
FlameBlade [-\]: this one?
Bogoliubon [1k\]: it's black's turn
Bogoliubon [1k\]: yeah
Bogoliubon [1k\]: do you have it Dan?
FlameBlade [-\]: I'm still thinking
FlameBlade [-\]: this is a classic problem
FlameBlade [-\]: C1 is definite
Bogoliubon [1k\]: sorry to spoil it then
logicg8 [3k\]: I was trying to make d3 work, but I think I've read all the failures now
FlameBlade [-\]: hrm
]
(;B[cs]C[FlameBlade [-\]: but I'm checking all variations
Bogoliubon [1k\]: this how you started to Adam?
logicg8 [3k\]: nope
FlameBlade [-\]: is there a stone at H3?
FlameBlade [-\]: or no?
Bogoliubon [1k\]: I don't think so.
FlameBlade [-\]: ok
FlameBlade [-\]: <--- has a non-ko variation if there is a stone at H3.
FlameBlade [-\]: hee hee
FlameBlade [-\]: black stone, that is
FlameBlade [-\]: but somehow, I'm not satisified with ko variation
FlameBlade [-\]: still readin
Bogoliubon [1k\]: let me see if I can see what you see with h3 stone in place.  I'm not satisfied with the ko variation either...
logicg8 [3k\]: I can't find the ko you guys are talking about
logicg8 [3k\]: b just seems connected
Bogoliubon [1k\]: how do you proceed Adam?
logicg8 [3k\]: for whom? w?
logicg8 [3k\]: if w d2 then e2
Bogoliubon [1k\]: yeah
Bogoliubon [1k\]: right, that's what lee changho marks as the solution
Bogoliubon [1k\]: but if w d1?
Bogoliubon [1k\]: it's been driving me mad for days
FlameBlade [-\]: here's what I think
FlameBlade [-\]: control?
FlameBlade [-\]: so I think ko works the best.
FlameBlade [-\]: so yeah, seems like ko is the solution
FlameBlade [-\]: just surprised that a pro didn't cover D1
Bogoliubon [1k\]: ok, I'm glad to hear that.
FlameBlade [-\]: D1 is definitely the most complicated variation
FlameBlade [-\]: in fact
Bogoliubon [1k\]: yeah I thought it strange too
FlameBlade [-\]: D2 and D1 deserves equal attention
FlameBlade [-\]: if I run across this problem...I'll try to fill you in
FlameBlade [-\]: with any details that I'm missing
logicg8 [3k\]: is it listed on SL?
Bogoliubon [1k\]: thanks, you said you've seen this 'classic problem' before
FlameBlade [-\]: I think this appears in Xuan Xuan
FlameBlade [-\]: but I have to dig around
FlameBlade [-\]: this is definitely a classic problem
Bogoliubon [1k\]: I'll look too.  very often stones go missing in translation.  I've got a Ma Xiaochun book where white regularly plays black stones
FlameBlade [-\]: haha
Bogoliubon [1k\]: a black stone with an even number on it is cause for suspicion.
FlameBlade [-\]: indeed
Bogoliubon [1k\]: thanks for having a look, I'm a bit more at peace now, I didn't notice the significance of h3 before either.
FlameBlade [-\]: no problem
Bogoliubon [1k\]: care to look at another pro game anyone?
FlameBlade [-\]: I'm going to bed pretty soon
logicg8 [3k\]: sure one last one
logicg8 [3k\]: I need to go to bed soon as well
Bogoliubon [1k\]: alright.  how about you find one, I'll grab a drink really quick

(;W[ds]C[Bogoliubon [1k\]: then what
Joven [-\]: D2
Joven [-\]: oh duh
Joven [-\]: cintrol
Bogoliubon [1k\]: that's all I can see too.  e1 seems the same
Joven [-\]: pros can be wrong i guess
Bogoliubon [1k\]: I just wanted a second opinion before I drew the 'Lee Changho is wrong' conclusion
Bogoliubon [1k\]: oh, here's some news, Jin hired me.
Joven [-\]: have fun ;p
Joven [-\]: still it can be good stuff just avoid his bs
Joven [-\]: but anyways good news
Bogoliubon [1k\]: I'll do my best.  Thanks, whatever it is it's better then the bullshit of work for a year for an opportunity that doesn't come up.
Bogoliubon [1k\]: how are things in the homestead?
Joven [-\]: pretty good
Joven [-\]: baby was napping on me while I worked on this problem
Bogoliubon [1k\]: beautiful.  it must be pretty nice.
Joven [-\]: nice and tiring
Joven [-\]: so I see adam gave you a ran for you money at two stones
Bogoliubon [1k\]: I'm sure.  
Bogoliubon [1k\]: yeah, I can beat him with three stones, but with two, I have so many options I confuse myself
Joven [-\]: yeah I saw in the one game that you killed him one place.. and just wanted to kill him too much elsewhere
Bogoliubon [1k\]: yeah, I suck online.
Bogoliubon [1k\]: and offline, but online moreso.
Joven [-\]: we all suck at go so its ok
Bogoliubon [1k\]: do you have a game in you this week?
Joven [-\]: yeah probably
Bogoliubon [1k\]: I best run now. 
Joven [-\]: ok ttyl
Bogoliubon [1k\]: thanks for the look at the problem
logicg8 [3k\]: d2
FlameBlade [-\]: what did Lee Chang Ho say?
FlameBlade [-\]: so question is...is there any variations that we're missing?

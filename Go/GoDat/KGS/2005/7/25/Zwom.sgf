EGC2005 [-\]: european pros do
heheh [4k\]: it is not possible that 4D player missread a ladder ?
tudorus [2d\]: sure velka
velkavolvo [2k?\]: So, black is the 4d?

EGC2005 [-\]: Black : Lucian Corlan 4d, white Seok bin Cho 7d
ZeroKun [-\]: you try reading out a ladder on a real board :P

dewey [3d\]: b doesn't need the ladder
heheh [4k\]: Tictactoe : what do you mean ?
boromake [1k\]: I'd be surprised if it weren't what I said :-)
tudorus [2d\]: in germany w used 9 min in a 60 min per game tournament and won easyly
dewey [3d\]: can't he just play n 6 ?
liza [-\]: would be fun if he played out the ladder :P
dewey [3d\]: after m 4 !!!
EGC2005 [-\]: w looked at other board and came back..
velkavolvo [2k?\]: And please do tell the organizers to put the pairing and result information promptly on the web. There are thousands of eager European players who are curious about the results.

ExplO [12k\]: at the korean federation
niklaus [6k\]: if he'd register as 1k that wouldn't be very interesting for him
velkavolvo [2k?\]: It would be ridiculous of them to register as 1ks in this tournament.

steinelos [3k\]: so probably is around 5d ;)
yiqiu: i've beaten 2dan as 3k too, better ranks doesn't mean you win for sure :)
EmTom [13k?\]: exactly

faithdrool [5k\]: true 2d will never lose to 3k in a regluar game, ever

faithdrool [5k\]: even if u were allowed, u better watch out when u are asleep
Midorya [11k\]: what about placing beer on the goban?

kimpaek: thats not arrogant at all,
faithdrool [5k\]: w is using his psychological tesuji
DaCapo05 [2k?\]: is this a team tournament?
ic3man [2k\]: that means nothing, it's normal
EGC2005 [-\]: playgo: no
playgo [5k\]: thx
measwel [13k\]: J9
blacklabel [20k\]: any games decided
Spacemen3 [3d\]: I think almost all tournaments with long time limits it's normal to get up and stretch your legs a bit, walking around having a look at the other boards...
ic3man [2k\]: exactly
faithdrool [5k\]: when w returns he will look at where b placed his stone last and make a little snicker, before leaving the room humming, only to come back 30 min later and play a tenuki
theolddan [2k\]: agree with Spacemen
boromake [1k\]: he's not rude as long as he remembers to say "hi" and "thx", if he doesn't do that then b will go to the next room and shout real loud that "w is rude!!!"
Worthless [?\]: Hmm, in these tournaments, do you sit on the floor, or on chairs?
EmTom [13k?\]: egc do other players walk and watch other games too???
Worthless [?\]: Surely chairs, right?
kimpaek: he just dont want to overconcentrate on the board maybe, sometimes you confuse yourself with to much thinking, walking around help you to evacuate  the pressure and so on
velkavolvo [2k?\]: At tables.
kimpaek: ^^
EGC2005 [-\]: chairs
Spacemen3 [3d\]: but I did have one incident with 3 stones stronger opponent who was watching the top board more than his own game and ended up losing to me :)
Worthless [?\]: I see, thanks.
theolddan [2k\]: at least no escapers at the tournament

blacklabel [20k\]: when u deicde to die
faithdrool [5k\]: to commit a murder onto urself
Worthless [?\]: Heh, I remember Sakata EIo, scarificing a whole group of stones, only to capture the stones that captured the stones he sacrificed
velkavolvo [2k?\]: The suicide rule prevents suicide as a ko threat when you're crushed.
measwel [13k\]: o?
Worthless [?\]: Except in NZ rules.

Midorya [11k\]: strange game
kimpaek: i think that wall b groups is dead if white play the t19 tesuji

Worthless [?\]: Is B really abandoning the center stones
Worthless [?\]: White's territory is massive
blacklabel [20k\]: n10 group?
blacklabel [20k\]: m 10 sry
Worthless [?\]: Yes..
EmTom [13k?\]: not much black can do in the center i guess :/
blacklabel [20k\]: i dont see aji, but im ddk ;)
faithdrool [5k\]: ok honestly... if you look carefully, P8 stone IS shining
faithdrool [5k\]: jsut focus around theat area
SoulShard [?\]: All the black stones on KGS shine..
Midorya [11k\]: and white
blacklabel [20k\]: white ones too
SoulShard [?\]: It's the white stones who get cool patterns.

Badduck [5d\]: b11
beublo [5k?\]: black can still connect on the side
Worthless [?\]: Yes..
Katoan2 [-\]: b wanting ponnuki imo
Worthless [?\]: I rather thought White would choose the center
beublo [5k?\]: why think now ? B11 is a must ain't it ?
Worthless [?\]: But it's Black's choice now
theolddan [2k\]: b lifes on left side now ?
blacklabel [20k\]: b14
Worthless [?\]: Yep..
Spacemen3 [3d\]: B11 best move
Worthless [?\]: C12 would be wasted otherwise
beublo [5k?\]: thanks
ic3man [2k\]: i don't get it
Worthless [?\]: If Black backs off, WHite seals the left and the center
faithdrool [5k\]: black has no choice right now but to play B11 right?
measwel [13k\]: blacklabel: do you like cheese?
theolddan [2k\]: w closes off his upper moyo in return
playgo [5k\]: but B14 is kind of sente
blacklabel [20k\]: sure

blacklabel [20k\]: sure
beublo [5k?\]: kind of ?
measwel [13k\]: so what black label is it? :)
blacklabel [20k\]: i like beer too ÖD
blacklabel [20k\]: its a band
beublo [5k?\]: B14 means "ok white, take all the west side, i won't mind"
measwel [13k\]: aaah! :)
blacklabel [20k\]: zu know ozzy osbourne
Spacemen3 [3d\]: B can't reduce the upper side moyou much even if he connects at B14
Worthless [?\]: Black B14 too good for White I think
playgo [5k\]: B11 B14 A12 and ?
Worthless [?\]: Since White now has a semi-defense against center reduction..
Spacemen3 [3d\]: while B11 really destroys most of left side territory - it is much more substantial

armyweiqi [15k\]: i tink o10 is nice for b, but if b o10, then w will attack upper right black group right?
zeze [1k?\]: R16 is a big move
olczyk [16k\]: In ten moves everyone hear will be saying how Whites position looks hopeless and B is winning big.

Worthless [?\]: Yes, Black took a little, White kept expanding
Uvas [-\]: no w can reduce side or bottom
Harleqin [2k\]: white leads by about 15 points?
EmTom [13k?\]: EGC black resigned?
EGC2005 [-\]: no
Snap [17k?\]: only five times? thats pretty optimistic for kgs i guess
Worthless [?\]: 15, I think so.
dorisdosis [24k?\]: how much  time both players have left   *pls
Worthless [?\]: INcluding komi
GoMe [5k\]: more.
Uvas [-\]: where is applebabie when you need her
playgo [5k\]: b is taking points in the center again, while white takes the sides 
measwel [13k\]: b should resign long time agon
EGC2005 [-\]: time left: b 0:42 w 2:04
Worthless [?\]: Heh, would've thought applebabie would be on everyone's censor list
boromake [1k\]: there aren't too many points in the center to be had
Snap [17k?\]: measwel, you should go tell him
Kabeer [14k\]: b has 42 minutes or seconds??
blacklabel [20k\]: min
EGC2005 [-\]: mins

TakeIt [5k?\]: egc: do you maybe know how Catalin is doing ?
leGOlas [1k\]: thx
EGC2005 [-\]: catalin has won
Worthless [?\]: I'd say Black's losing move is B14...
TakeIt [5k?\]: thx
playgo [5k\]: anyone of the players sweating or having peculiar tics?
beublo [5k?\]: only one misclick per 64 moves, EGC2005 is doing well :)
Snap [17k?\]: no surprise really. of course 7dan is stronger, thats why he IS rated 3 stones stronger
SOJU [?\]: catalin is good
Harleqin [2k\]: against whom?
EGC2005 [-\]: :P
faithdrool [5k\]: who is catalin
EGC2005 [-\]: dunno...
EGC2005 [-\]: catalin taranu 5p
Worthless [?\]: Catalin Taranu 5p..
EGC2005 [-\]: from romania
descandal [?\]: he's 5^p now?
EmTom [13k?\]: yeah we want to see his game too ;)
rausku [?\]: oh come on
Spacemen3 [3d\]: he'll be on the top table soon enough ^^
Worthless [?\]: He's been 5p for a long time.
EmTom [13k?\]: spaceman im counting on it
faithdrool [5k\]: he  will llose to this W?
faithdrool [5k\]: this W is STRONG++
Worthless [?\]: Hard to tell...
EmTom [13k?\]: will he faithdrol?
Spacemen3 [3d\]: you can't tell how strong W is from this game
faithdrool [5k\]: will he?
Worthless [?\]: B made many mistakes, I'd say, though I'm far below his level :)
Zensuround [16k\]: I think  5p is stronger than 7d
darkmage [9d\]: whats this?
Hawkeye [22k\]: but the pro's are stronger
SOJU [?\]: sure it is
Worthless [?\]: Exactly..Hard to say how strong
Fredrikk [9k\]: Darkmage EGC

faithdrool [5k\]: de corea tu se?/

Worthless [?\]: And let's not forget KOrean amateuyrs are vicious
dogbert [?\]: don't know whether liyue made a pro or not, anyone?

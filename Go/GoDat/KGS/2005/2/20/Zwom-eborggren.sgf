Zwom [13k\]: How's it going Erik?
eborggren [?\]: It is going well...sorry it has been so long
Zwom [13k\]: no thang, valentine's day and all.  Enjoy love do you?
eborggren [?\]: Married to a great woman, having a blast
eborggren [?\]: How is everything going with you?
Zwom [13k\]: I've been sick since wednesday, I'm not too bad right now but hardly greatt either.
eborggren [?\]: It seems like everyone, even stretched across multiple continents is getting sick...truly a winter funk
eborggren [?\]: at least you got some great news to keep you up beat while your sick
Zwom [13k\]: I know it, maybe I caught whatever you had over email
Zwom [13k\]: Stony Brook is certainly good news.
eborggren [?\]: I am envious that you could be back in New York, would love to go back there for school
Zwom [13k\]: I may be your little brother but you will still have to call me Dr. Borggren.  NY Is an option for you to go back to school.
eborggren [?\]: Yeah, leaving from here we may try to head back to West Point and I may try for Columbia or NYU law
]RE[W+26.50]
;W[cd]CR[cd]WL[1671.510]C[Zwom [13k\]: what's at West Point?
eborggren [?\]: Erica possibly working in the hospital there and maybe even teaching at SOSH
Zwom [13k\]: Will it still be an option for you to teach there or not anymore?
eborggren [?\]: Not for me unless I were to go out and do great things get a Phd and prove myself in academia which I really don't want to do right now
Zwom [13k\]: to busy exercising I guess.  Well the clock will tell us exactly when our hour is up.
eborggren [?\]: all right...sounds good
eborggren [?\]: can we review the eye thing again?
eborggren [?\]: by the way, pretty cool logo by your name again
Zwom [13k\]: Sure just play and we'll talk as we go.  Thanks.
Zwom [13k\]: That's Saturn and two of her moons, there were three but it got cropped off.
eborggren [?\]: cool stuff, let s play

eborggren [?\]: so in essence, by giving you the option to cut my black at C7 I gave up a lot
Zwom [13k\]: right, sometimes less is more.
Zwom [13k\]: when two stones have this diagonal relationship.  d7 is a very vulnerable point.
Zwom [13k\]: it was my mistake making it in the first place.
eborggren [?\]: ok
Zwom [13k\]: in games when I see this shape or make this shape it is an invitation to cut.
eborggren [?\]: in other words put one of your guys in between the two stones
Zwom [13k\]: Well it's six after 6
Zwom [13k\]: you have to run now?
eborggren [?\]: yeah we need to get going...thanks again, though I had fun again today
eborggren [?\]: this is good stuff
Zwom [13k\]: Go is a great game no?
eborggren [?\]: it is fun...challenging the brain...so good for you too
Zwom [13k\]: and it just get's deeper and deeper... consider the fact that games are played on 19x19 grids.
Zwom [13k\]: well is it going to be this time next week?
eborggren [?\]: I see it on the television and how quickly guys play and see what they want....amazing.
eborggren [?\]: I'll have to let you know...depends on whether we think this is the church we are going to attend...does it work ok for you?
Zwom [13k\]: Go on the television, I'm jealous of you you know that?  Seoul is go headquarters of planet earth.  It's all the same to me.
Zwom [13k\]: all the times are the same to me that is.
eborggren [?\]: sounds good...yeah probably with go on the tv is unless you speak Korean you just see guys putting pieces on a board
eborggren [?\]: that sentence makes no sense....all I am saying is it is hard to follow
Zwom [13k\]: learn korean then
Zwom [13k\]: are you getting better at that?
eborggren [?\]: I have been looking for something to do between the hours of midnight and 4:30 in the morning!
Zwom [13k\]: that's the spirit.
eborggren [?\]: I can read Korean ok, in other words I know the alphabet, but I have no idea what I am saying unless it is food and then I know it through familiarity
Zwom [13k\]: I see.  well have fun at church.
Zwom [13k\]: Don't take no guff from those swine.
eborggren [?\]: always thinking critically, you taught me that!
eborggren [?\]: you have a great day as well!
Zwom [13k\]: alright. fair thee well o my brother.
eborggren [?\]: take care!  see you next week!

eborggren [?\]: /
eborggren [?\]: ?
Zwom [13k\]: d3 would be an atari because c3 would then only have 1 liberty.
Zwom [13k\]: 1 liberty = atari.
eborggren [?\]: 1 liberty being open space
Zwom [13k\]: right 
Zwom [13k\]: so pop quiz hot shot...
Zwom [13k\]: how many liberties does  your f1 group have.
Zwom [13k\]: ?
Zwom [13k\]: f1 group means everything connected to f1
eborggren [?\]: two? I am guessing
Zwom [13k\]: notice that g7 is connected to f1that's the other end of the chain.  Don't guess count.
eborggren [?\]: I count thirteen spaces back there but I do not know what I am counting exactly, is it all open positions?
Zwom [13k\]: go ahead and pass really quick so I can make marks.
Zwom [13k\]: those are the liberties.
Zwom [13k\]: in order for that group to die I would need white pieces at all seven of those spots.
Zwom [13k\]: I can't make move six without having first seven and seven without first six, therefore I can't make either move and black is alive.

Zwom [13k\]:  The original meaning of this stratagem is: on the surface we appeare peaceable, letting the opponent believe in us, and furthermore making him numb to the main idea.  But we secretly prepare a dagger, waiting for the right moment to act, so the opponent has no time to react.
Zwom [13k\]: ...
Zwom [13k\]: The application to Go is:
Zwom [13k\]: It looks as if we are playing aimless, ineffective moves, but actually it is a secret opereation (SOG).  When the opponent becomes confused by the false front or relaxes his vigilance, then we suddenly make our move, leaving him helpless.

Zwom [13k\]: The exchange of the white marked stone for the black one was made long ago.  Here Black's correct play is osae at a, settling the position.  Because just the stump of this error has been left behind, White has a definite opportunity.  Under normal circumstances, Black would be in the lead.  Black has about 55 points, White at least 45 points plus a little potential in the center, and it is White's turn to play.  Although with steady play White would stay a little behind, in the final analysis the fight would be decided in the endgame.  It all depends on what strategy White uses.

Zwom [13k\]: Zwom [13k\]: Sometimes retreat is the best option. Zwom [13k\]: ... Zwom [13k\]: Withdraw the entire army.  Leave the enemy behind.  Advance by retreating.  Wait for an opportunity to break the enemy.  When the enemy forces have absolute superiority, our side cannot defeat them.  We only have three options: surrender, negotiate peace, or retreat.  Surrender is utter defeat.  Negotiating peace is semi-defeat.  Retreat is not defeat; it is the key to turning inferiority into victory.  The meaning when applied to Go is:  When the opponent has a powerful position, or when we cannot fight staunchly, it is necessary for us to give way.  Only by preserving our strength can we have the possibility of awaiting an opportunity to counter-attack and turn the tables on our opponent.

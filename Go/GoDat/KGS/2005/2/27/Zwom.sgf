Zwom [13k\]: The original meaning of this stratagem is:  Something that is already dead returns in another guise.  A direct explanation is to use everything you can to realize your own plans.
Zwom [13k\]: Applying this to Go, we can understand it as: use the power of stones that are already lost to make a gain.  Any such gain would be free of cost.  THis plot always comes after abandoning some stones, which are then put to further use.  You could say there is an inevitable relationship between this stratagem and sacrifice tactics.  There are two possibilities for this stratagem.
Zwom [13k\]: First, some of your stones were captured earlier, and now that the time is ripe they can be utilized.  
Zwom [13k\]: Second, You abandon some stones on purpose, to put them to use.  In the end, the aim is to take advantage of the situation to gain some profit.

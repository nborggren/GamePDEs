eborggren [?\]: It goes well, how are you doing?
Zwom [13k\]: not bad, busy, but not bad.
eborggren [?\]: We've had a busy weekend as well, we went on a little ski trip to eastern Korea...beautiful place
Zwom [13k\]: that's cool.  That must've been fun, it's been awhile since I've been on a ski trip.
eborggren [?\]: We only got to ski for one afternoon but it actually worked out to be perfect as it was frigid
eborggren [?\]: skiing is fun though!
Zwom [13k\]: certainly is.  Would you like to hop right to it?
eborggren [?\]: sure
eborggren [?\]: bigger board today
Zwom [13k\]: a bit bigger I'll pass 5 times so you get six stones wherever you want.
eborggren [?\]: ok

How is your new church?
eborggren [?\]: actually, we really like it.  The pastor is great and that is really what we have been struggling to find here.  Someone who talks truth.
eborggren [?\]: As you said last week, lots of stuff to watch out for
Zwom [13k\]: definitely can't believe everything you see and hear.  Truth is a pretty hard commodity to find.
eborggren [?\]: it certainly is, the thing that is amazing about truth though is that you know it when you hear it if you are really listening with a discerning ear, and not with what you WANT to hear
Zwom [13k\]: word.  Well I got to run too. take care now.
eborggren [?\]: I as well...you have a great week!  
Zwom [13k\]: bye now.
eborggren [?\]: peace

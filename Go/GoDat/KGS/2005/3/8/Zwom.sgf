Zwom [13k\]: There is a game by Yi Changho (Same as Lee Chango?) versus Mok Sinyeok, though I might be slaughtering the names, that I've found very interesting.
Zwom [13k\]: I did a pretty good job reading out this sequence.  I figured 36-42 was a big enough threat on whites eyespace for him to take an extra move back there to ease his worried mind and I get a great point, and a great wall aimed at a hoshi stone and still get to respond to the kakari.  I've been experimenting with takemayas move a lot, it provides a slew of options s5 seems to be a really good point later on with it in place.
Zwom [13k\]: and in this scenario it seemed to work well, despite the long range, with my new wall.
Zwom [13k\]: how worried do I need to be of ladder breakers here?  I figured I'd worry about it later.

Given the result of the game ( I lose by 1.5) d5 was kind of the game loser but it's to early for much use of such an abstraction.

]
;W[nl]CR[nl]WL[696.172]C[Zwom [13k\]: it's also a good extension of his moyo.  I didn't read this out to carefully in the game but in reflection, given the q7 aji, it seems like I either get into his side or get a free move in the center.  So despite his remarks this result still feels pretty even to me.
Zwom [13k\]: now would be a good time to ask a couple questions that have been troubling me lately.
]
;B[mm]CR[mm]BL[618.365]
;W[kk]CR[kk]WL[691.534]C[Zwom [13k\]: the position is such that now would probably be a good time to give a thorough counting.
Zwom [13k\]: The moyo building stage is complete for white and more or less so for black too.  So it's invasions and reductions from here on out.
Zwom [13k\]: I didn't count at the time, I'm chronically lazy with counting, but here is what I count now.
Zwom [13k\]: I thought 45 was a conservative number of prospective points and 60 was an optimistic one for blacks big moyo
Zwom [13k\]: 14 say for the top right corner and 14 as well for the top left.
Zwom [12k\]: grand total of 73ish to 88ish points for black.  
Zwom [12k\]: whites big moyo prospected 75 points or so
Zwom [12k\]: and 25 or so points elsewhere.
Zwom [12k\]: grand total of a hundred points or so for white.
Zwom [12k\]: So now for my counting questions.
Zwom [12k\]: First off, cumulative game totals appear to tend to sum up around 120-130 roughly so that in and of itself tells me my numbers aren't all that great. 
Zwom [12k\]: second off the upper and lower limits of the black guess suggests a resolution of about 19%.
Zwom [12k\]: Now I can predict densities on Titan to about 4% and Titan is cerca 1.4 billion kms away.
Zwom [12k\]: As a scientist 19% resolution means my instrument needs some fine tuning.
Zwom [12k\]: So the question is this:
Zwom [12k\]: Poetically speaking a game of Go is one in which territory starts off totally ambiguous and devolves in ambiguity to a point where it is finally defined, after two passes.
Zwom [12k\]: But how then, especially in a circumstance like now, do you count?  Make me marks with triangles and squares and what not as to what to count as white territory, black territory, and neutral ground.  What do you count the score as?
Zwom [12k\]: Before my job here at the university and my trials with madness I attended a black jack school to become a dealer.  Obviously counting was important there too, but more so fast accurate counting.  In go with the clock running fast accurate counting seems just as important.
Zwom [12k\]: How long would it take you to accurately count this?  I was faster than anyone at the school for counting but slow in my personal opinion, it would take me about 3-4 minutes for a good count.  Which is way to many byo-yomi periods to even consider it an option to do.
Zwom [12k\]: By the way, I was expelled from black jack school for having a drug test come up positive for just about everything, but where is the fairness in administoring a test that doesn't give the student time to prepare for?
Zwom [12k\]: so it goes.  lessons learned, don't fuck with whitey.
]
;B[ig]CR[ig]BL[614.476]LB[ne:C][lk:A][il:D][pm:B]C[Zwom [12k\]: This was a difficult decision for me to make.  Despite not counting I new I had to get all up in whites turf to win.
Zwom [12k\]: a-d are also moves I considered.  I wanted to D just to preseve the moyo, but even if all the territory turned black I still wouldn't have won I don't think so wasn't an option.

Zwom [13k\]: thanks
Zwom [13k\]: do you want to review?
Carcer [9k\]: sry about the rank bad system if you only lose by 1.5 and lose a rank
Zwom [13k\]: So that's that.  I thought this was a really good game in that a lot can be learned and was learned from it.  And it hasn't even been reviewed by you yet.
Zwom [13k\]: And just the fact that it ended up a 1.5 difference.  Though given the number of mistakes on both sides this is pretty coincidental.
Zwom [13k\]: You've commented before on my strategy changing habit and this game is proof that I've been working on stopping that shit.   My strategy, as is usually the case when given handicap stones, is to build a big moyo and turn it into a big territory.
Zwom [13k\]: Were it not for the p7 liberty that haunted me twice it would have worked well too.
Zwom [13k\]: I didn't notice this until my third run through the game how much my endgame play cost me.  Albeit the mistake was in wasting time rather than actual points, but effectively I guess they are equivalent in that it gives the opponent opportunity to take the big points before you do.

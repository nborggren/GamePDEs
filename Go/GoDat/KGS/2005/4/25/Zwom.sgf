blubb [7k\]: hf
blubb [7k\]: right
minue622 [6d\]: meaning of this move...
blubb [7k\]: yes
minue622 [6d\]: in my view,
blubb [7k\]: I guess it's urgent not because of that shape but because it's at the border between two opposing influence areas
minue622 [6d\]: meaning of that kind move is just for "expanding my moyo, at the same time , reducing opp's moyo"
blubb [7k\]: and allows to develop the own one very nicely
blubb [7k\]: similarly to loose attacks instead of attachments to an unsettled group
blubb [7k\]: I'd like to finish this review, need to have a break
minue622 [6d\]: ok,,
minue622 [6d\]: btw,
minue622 [6d\]: in my guess
minue622 [6d\]: today's 2 examples which show good timing to invade 3-3 , reducing opp  to be overconcentrated,,,,will be helpful for u,,
blubb [7k\]: thank you for showing
minue622 [6d\]: welcome~
blubb [7k\]: also, maybe I should not avoid obvious moves so often
blubb [7k\]: that's probably a bad habit cause by too much blitzing
minue622 [6d\]: um...blubb,
blubb [7k\]: when blitzing, it's somewhat advantageous to surprize the opponent
minue622 [6d\]: i dont think so,
minue622 [6d\]: blubb,
minue622 [6d\]: so_called ur bad habbit is very common and universal in all of middle level players
minue622 [6d\]: regardless of whether the player is fast player or slow player
blubb [7k\]: hmm
minue622 [6d\]: i mean,,
minue622 [6d\]: in the process of improvement of Go rank,
minue622 [6d\]: such a bad habbit is...normal and,,
minue622 [6d\]: common thing 
blubb [7k\]: perhaps some experience with unusual moves is necessary in order to become more confident about what play is good 
minue622 [6d\]: right,
blubb [7k\]: this reminds me on the way I used to play table tennis when I was a child
minue622 [6d\]: what u mean?
minue622 [6d\]: tennis is very different from Go
blubb [7k\]: yes, it is
blubb [7k\]: but I encounter something very similar in my way of play:
blubb [7k\]: as child, playing table tennis, I was always thrying things which I didn't master yet
minue622 [6d\]: um..i c,
blubb [7k\]: that's why I rarely won
blubb [7k\]: (which wasn't as important to me as to the other ones)
blubb [7k\]: doing so, I learned a lot
blubb [7k\]: but didn't win :)
minue622 [6d\]: i c,,
blubb [7k\]: I think, in an important game of go, I'd play more reasonable stuff, as well
minue622 [6d\]: btw,,off_line Go was really fun
blubb [7k\]: may I get C for a last comment, please?
minue622 [6d\]: sure
blubb [7k\]: thx

minue622 [6d\]: and,,i think this case is very reallistic,
blubb [7k\]: hmm, let me try
minue622 [6d\]: can happen in amateur high dan's real game
minue622 [6d\]: this opening
blubb [7k\]: on a first glance, I can see four big points
minue622 [6d\]: u have c
blubb [7k\]: now I am asking which is bigger than the other ones
minue622 [6d\]: ok,,
blubb [7k\]: these are my candidates
blubb [7k\]: looking at A:
minue622 [6d\]: i will tell u , improtant factors which we should consider for deciding b's next move
blubb [7k\]: the potential of black development does not seem to be be so big
blubb [7k\]: but it prevents some white development
blubb [7k\]: anyway, both C11 and C9 are settled
minue622 [6d\]: yes,
blubb [7k\]: so, B seems more important
minue622 [6d\]: so, that area is not "hot"
minue622 [6d\]: i mean,,,left side is not "hot"
blubb [7k\]: because F17 is a little weaker, to my view
blubb [7k\]: at the right side,
blubb [7k\]: white is comparatively weak
minue622 [6d\]: yes,
blubb [7k\]: whilst black could gain much by attacking it
minue622 [6d\]: yes
blubb [7k\]: and unlike C, D would even form a nice framework
blubb [7k\]: so D would be my choice
minue622 [6d\]: good blubb,
minue622 [6d\]: D looks very good in this case
blubb [7k\]: although I am not sure if I'd prefer it to B in any case
minue622 [6d\]: D is surely better than D
minue622 [6d\]: better than B
blubb [7k\]: maybe F15 instead of F14
minue622 [6d\]: much much better
blubb [7k\]: hm
blubb [7k\]: hehe
minue622 [6d\]: reason is simple,
minue622 [6d\]: right side W is much weaker
blubb [7k\]: that's for sure
blubb [7k\]: no doubt about that
minue622 [6d\]: so, B's  threat on w group is much smaller, or less effective than b's D move threat on W's right side stones
blubb [7k\]: but F17 is the weakest part of black, I suppose
blubb [7k\]: so I have to compare which is better:
minue622 [6d\]: blubb,,
minue622 [6d\]: speaking very obvious things,
blubb [7k\]: (1) to attack a weak white group, gain a nice moyo and leave F17 alone for now, or 
minue622 [6d\]: the questions r always important
minue622 [6d\]: which is my or opp's main frame work
blubb [7k\]: (2) to strengthen F17, gain a nice moyo and let R13 become stronger
minue622 [6d\]: ok,,i will show u expected sequences

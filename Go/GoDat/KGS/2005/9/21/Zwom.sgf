troll [2k\]: the closer together, that your opponent's stones are when you cut, the more it hurts
Zwom [10k\]: interesting.  I think I jump the gun with my attack here then
troll [2k\]: this is why, if you have two groups that you can not connect, trying ito connect is usually bad.
troll [2k\]: extend them in opposite directions so that your opponent does not get a splitting attck, is advised

troll [2k\]: yes but if you can extend your walls a bit further and make eyes, then Q15 becomes weak.

troll [2k\]: not so that it dies, but enough for you to take territory
troll [2k\]: yes
troll [2k\]: but L11 is a bit heavy
Zwom [10k\]: I see.
troll [2k\]: two cutting points

troll [2k\]: in a fight, you want to be connected, but if you can not
troll [2k\]: try to avoid being cut

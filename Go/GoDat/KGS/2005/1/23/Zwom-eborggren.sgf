Zwom [15k\]: Not much how you doing?
eborggren [?\]: I am doing pretty well...wanted to talk to you about a new time for this every Sunday.
Zwom [15k\]: what do you have in mind?
eborggren [?\]: Erica and I have decided to go to church on Saturday night, freeing up Sunday morning more...was wondering if this time would work for you.
Zwom [15k\]: that's fine by me, it's all the same.
eborggren [?\]: Actually, lets look at 1000 for me, 6 for you...
eborggren [?\]: Forgot to clear with the wife!
Zwom [15k\]: alright, then.
eborggren [?\]: Great!  Thanks!
Zwom [15k\]: No thang.  Did you see my pretty picture of crescent Jupiter?
Zwom [15k\]: Galileo would cry.
eborggren [?\]: When would I have seen that?
Zwom [15k\]: Right now, next to my name.
eborggren [?\]: oh, I see...pretty cool stuff
Zwom [15k\]: I work on a cool spaceship.  Alright let's do this.
eborggren [?\]: where does it come from?

;B[ij]CR[ij]C[Zwom [15k\]: A flyby, in this case Cassini, is the only way to get the angle for a crescent planet.

Zwom [15k\]: a move like this doesn't accomplish to much, especially in that you have two weak groups on the board.  better to make the weak stronger then the strong stronger right?
eborggren [?\]: right

Zwom [15k\]: ok.  first off notice you have about 28 pieces surrounding seven points of territory.
eborggren [?\]: o
eborggren [?\]: O
eborggren [?\]: ok
Zwom [15k\]: and I have in the lower right corner 9 pieces surrounding 8 points of territory.
Zwom [15k\]: why do you think I mention this?
eborggren [?\]: right
eborggren [?\]: because I waste a lot of pieces to gain little territory
Zwom [15k\]: indeed.

eborggren [?\]: I don't know what the deal is for me, but I just don't see things very well in this game
Zwom [15k\]: Indeed, but there are some good lessons to be learned in this game.  
Zwom [15k\]: It just takes a little practice.  Let's review a bit.
eborggren [?\]: ok

])
(;W[ae]CR[ae]
;B[hf]CR[hf]C[Zwom [15k\]: and you take and now I have to find a threat.
eborggren [?\]: i see
Zwom [15k\]: ko fights are fun, we'll do a whole lesson on them next week.
eborggren [?\]: sounds good
Zwom [15k\]: I've got a homework assignment for you.  fear not.
eborggren [?\]: ok...
Zwom [15k\]: www.goproblems.com is a wonderful wonderful resource.
eborggren [?\]: ok
Zwom [15k\]: Now I'll give you a bit more direction than that.
Zwom [15k\]: There will be a section called time trial with levels starting at 30 kyu and then going down from their.
Zwom [15k\]: there.
Zwom [15k\]: now try the 30 kyu one, 
Zwom [15k\]: or any of the easy problems.  You'll quickly see the benefit of that website.  
eborggren [?\]: ok
Zwom [15k\]: Now when I use it, it is in situations where my boss says he's going to meet me in 5 minutes so I'll do 8 or 9 problems in the mean time.  You don't need to go crazy like your little brother with the stuff, but if you ever have just a couple extra minutes, it's fun.
eborggren [?\]: I'll take a look...
Zwom [15k\]: Great, I hope after your intuition is developed a bit more I can trigger a competitive spark in you.
Zwom [15k\]: Are you enjoying this?
eborggren [?\]: I am enjoying it...I don't have a lot of time outside this time with you to devote to it which makes me feel bad because I feel like I am not competitive for you
eborggren [?\]: My real draw to this game is that it provides us an opportunity to hang out each week for an hour
Zwom [15k\]: I hear that.
eborggren [?\]: I will say, it is an enjoyable way to spen that hour though!
Zwom [15k\]: Do you feel like you see more this week than last week and last week in comparison to the week before?
eborggren [?\]: As you can see, my real struggle is knowing when I still need to protect and when I need to threaten...I just don't see the territory that well yet
Zwom [15k\]: right, territory is funny in go, it begins totally ambiguous and get's less ambiguos as the time rolls on.
Zwom [15k\]: Now I have a book called 'Go Proverbs' that I'll stick in the mail to you, but if you don't have time for it maybe it would be better if I just orchestrated lessons out of it instead.  What do you think?
eborggren [?\]: Probably would be best for the lessons
eborggren [?\]: that way they actually happen
eborggren [?\]: well, brother I need to get running here!
Zwom [15k\]: That's my thought too.  Alright, well fair thee well my friend.
eborggren [?\]: and you as well!  Have a wonderful week!
Zwom [15k\]: you too.  bye now.
eborggren [?\]: peace

Zwom [15k\]: lesson: to attack opponent, threaten cutting him off from connecting to living pieces, and/or threaten to destroy his eyespace.
Zwom [15k\]: it takes some practice, but you'll just get pushed around into submission if you don't.

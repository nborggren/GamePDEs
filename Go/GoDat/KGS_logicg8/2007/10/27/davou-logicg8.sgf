davou [4k\]: threat to capture at A, VS no threat to capture
davou [4k\]: good.
davou [4k\]: also
davou [4k\]: here
davou [4k\]: because if W tries to cut, you will have a weak group to attack
logicg8 [25k?\]: I see. A wasted move
davou [4k\]: no
davou [4k\]: but by letting white cut, you gain something 
davou [4k\]: you have two strong groups, and he gets one weak one.
davou [4k\]: its that type of situation that lets you make territory
]
;W[fb]C[davou [4k\]: lets resume
logicg8 [25k?\]: I see. I can let the cut happen and get strong in the fight while my opponent has to struggle to live
davou [4k\]: no,
davou [4k\]: you can only let cuts happen in two situations
davou [4k\]: number one, the cut is not important
davou [4k\]: or number two, your strong on both sides of the cut, even if he sucessfully cuts you

logicg8 [9k\]: When you have only one liberty left

logicg8 [9k\]: Your stone at C1 will be safe
ellebelle [?\]: whats wrong w/ c1?
ellebelle [?\]: but then i lose liberties
logicg8 [9k\]: See how there is only 1 line coming out of C1
logicg8 [9k\]: That means it can be captured next turn
ellebelle [?\]: but my liberties
logicg8 [9k\]: You will have two liberites when you connect

logicg8 [9k\]: The little ones are points
ellebelle [?\]: and teh big
logicg8 [9k\]: The black little ones are your points and the white little ones are my points
logicg8 [9k\]: the big ones are the stones we played left on the board
logicg8 [9k\]: the transparent ones are the dead stones left on the board
ellebelle [?\]: i still don't get teh big ones
ellebelle [?\]: i have more little ones than you how come i have less points

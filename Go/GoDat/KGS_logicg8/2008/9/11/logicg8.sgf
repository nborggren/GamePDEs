FlameBlade [-\]: whole game is pretty much fighting
logicg8 [5k\]: attacking is pretty much lost on me
logicg8 [5k\]: at least while making profit
FlameBlade [-\]: and somehow it got good for black
FlameBlade [-\]: here's a tip.  It's pretty hard to attack for profit if you don't have a good plan
FlameBlade [-\]: try to visualize where the fight will go
FlameBlade [-\]: then visualize how profit will appear there
FlameBlade [-\]: but it's too hard to fight like that if your opponent's groups are too strong
FlameBlade [-\]: like how strong white group was there
FlameBlade [-\]: look at black stones in middle
FlameBlade [-\]: they're all dame
logicg8 [5k\]: Yeah, but didn't I get the lower right because of the attack they gave?
FlameBlade [-\]: sure
FlameBlade [-\]: but that may mean you lost potential on right side
Joven [?\]: but you could have gotten more
FlameBlade [-\]: it could be a moyo for what I know
logicg8 [5k\]: I see
FlameBlade [-\]: attacks on L3 felt very stubborn
logicg8 [5k\]: I'm not trying to argue btw I just seek clarity
FlameBlade [-\]: why bang against a strong group when you could just take big points?
FlameBlade [-\]: something to think about
logicg8 [5k\]: Indeed
logicg8 [5k\]: It seems very clear and simple when you say it like that
logicg8 [5k\]: I just need to frame it in my mind properly to apply it in games

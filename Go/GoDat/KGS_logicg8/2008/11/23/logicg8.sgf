FlameBlade [4d\]: why not get out
FlameBlade [4d\]: and destroy black crap
FlameBlade [4d\]: so in other words...
FlameBlade [4d\]: should look for alternative options

logicg8 [4k\]: Yeah
FlameBlade [4d\]: there is just so much space here
FlameBlade [4d\]: it's much easier to just let and live
FlameBlade [4d\]: and take millions of points
FlameBlade [4d\]: there are two conditions for killing.
FlameBlade [4d\]: 1.  You're absolutely sure that you will kill
FlameBlade [4d\]: OR...
FlameBlade [4d\]: 2. you're losing the game, you need something desperate
FlameBlade [4d\]: is that clear?

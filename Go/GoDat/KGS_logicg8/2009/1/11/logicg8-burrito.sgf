]RE[W+6.50]
;B[dd]BL[1790.259]C[burrito [4k\]: have fun

;W[pp]WL[1795.4]
;B[pd]BL[1780.01]C[logicg8 [4k\]: Go is not fun its torture
]
;W[cp]WL[1779.287]C[burrito [4k\]: have torture!
]
;B[ep]BL[1772.527]
;W[hp]WL[1750.828]C[burrito [4k\]: aw now - you have to try and make think on 3rd move already
logicg8 [4k\]: Sorry about that
]
;B[dm]BL[1694.718]C[burrito [4k\]: I was thinking maybe we could just replay a pro game and pretend it was ours
]
;W[eo]WL[1719.425]C[burrito [4k\]: see what they say in review
logicg8 [4k\]: I think that's an awesome idea
]
;B[fo]BL[1647.485]C[logicg8 [4k\]: Except when Evil Greg says. "Wow. Why did you play this move?"
logicg8 [4k\]: I'll have no more idea than when it's my own bad moves
burrito [4k\]: "It should be obvious to anyone over 20k."

;W[en]WL[1674.744]
;B[dp]BL[1641.442]
;W[cn]WL[1616.867]C[burrito [4k\]: maybe we can kind a good one with lots of commentary
]
;B[cq]BL[1614.487]
;W[co]WL[1566.935]C[burrito [4k\]: I'll be takemiya since tabemasu asked me to study some of his games
burrito [4k\]: it'll look like I've been doing that
]
;B[fn]BL[1560.77]
;W[em]WL[1548.493]C[burrito [4k\]: I only vaguely remember this joseki since I never play it
logicg8 [4k\]: I shouldn't play this joseki. It's too damn complicated
burrito [4k\]: thanks again for making me think.  I appreciate it :)
burrito [4k\]: is there a way to indicate sarcasm on kgs?
logicg8 [4k\]: Saul recommended I play it and he likes to show Evil Greg's evil trick in this joseki
]
;B[dr]BL[1433.722]C[burrito [4k\]: ok thanks for that info
burrito [4k\]: I'll keep it simple
burrito [4k\]: unless I've already been tricked
burrito [4k\]: in which case I should warn you that he showed me an even eviler counter trick
burrito [4k\]: game-ending
burrito [4k\]: so don't even think about it!
]
;W[fm]WL[1434.06]
;B[ho]BL[1366.864]C[burrito [4k\]: seriously - now you've got me scared
burrito [4k\]: maybe the trick is to tell me there's a trick when there's no trick?
logicg8 [4k\]: I'm not that clever
burrito [4k\]: no jedi mind tricks
burrito [4k\]: the problem is, I don't know whether or not to believe you
burrito [4k\]: because that could be part of the trick
logicg8 [4k\]: I don't remember the exact trick, and it would have only possibly helped me if our colors were reversed
]
;W[io]WL[1326.725]C[burrito [4k\]: I have another idea.  Maybe we can just chop this game off at the 9x9 mark and decided it from that
]
;B[ip]BL[1222.537]C[logicg8 [4k\]: Okay, okay... *now* who's the one causing complications?
burrito [4k\]: I told you I have an evil counter-trick
]
;W[go]WL[1022.24]C[burrito [4k\]: Now you just need to figure out if I am the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet or his enemy's. 
logicg8 [4k\]: Well now that I know you've seen the Princess Bride I'm completely thrown
burrito [4k\]: this would have been easier if you hadn't actually thought about your response at all
burrito [4k\]: as I clearly didn't think through my play, it really was the only fair thing
